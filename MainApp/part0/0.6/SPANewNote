Title Add Note
User->Browser: Enters text in the input and clicks submit button
Browser->Server: Sends a post to server
Note Over Server: 
    Server gets the inputed data and adds it to an array of Notes
End Note
Server-->Browser: Responds with a 201 status (created)

Note Over Browser:
    Uses the JavaScript code it fetched from the server (JSC).
    JSC code uses an event handler on the form submit event, to handle the event on a diferent way
    JSC prevents default behavior of the form submit event (i guess
    to avoid reloading the page?)
    JSC adds the new inputed data to the grid
    JSC sends a post to the server with the new data
End Note


Note Over Server:
    Gets the data posted from the browsers and process accordingly (Add, Delete, Modify...)
End Note
